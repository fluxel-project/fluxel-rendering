//! Native GPU ownership plus fixed-artifact Copy, Compute, and Raster execution for Fluxel.
//!
//! This crate exposes no `wgpu-hal` types. It opens one headless DX12 or Vulkan
//! device, owns buffers and 2D textures, and executes deliberately fixed Copy,
//! Compute, and Raster subsets of a portable RenderGraph plan through barriers,
//! one submission, completion, and lease-backed retirement. On Windows with
//! either native graphics feature, the narrow presentation façade owns a surface/swapchain
//! while retaining its window through acquired-image retirement. Narrow immutable buffer and
//! whole RGBA8 texture uploads retain staging and destination storage through
//! completion.
//!
//! Fixed raster recipes are intentionally closed adapter contracts:
//!
//! ```
//! use fluxel_rhi::adapter::fixed_artifacts::RasterKernel;
//!
//! let _identity = RasterKernel::Triangle.portable_identity();
//! ```
//!
//! They are not stable root-facade types:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use fluxel_rhi::RasterKernel;
//! ```
//!
//! The GL-family command and state layers are private implementation details:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use fluxel_rhi::webgl2::api::GlFamilyApi;
//! ```
