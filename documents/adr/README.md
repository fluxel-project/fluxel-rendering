# Architecture Decision Records

This directory preserves the small set of decisions that constrain future
work. Plans and reviews record a release's investigation and evidence; an ADR
records only a decision that remains relevant after that release.

The design documents describe the current system and how it works. ADRs record
why a durable boundary was chosen, its rejected alternatives, and its cost;
they link to designs instead of duplicating implementation detail. An ADR may
later be marked `Superseded by: ADR-NNNN`.

## Release mapping

Newest first. “Confirmed” means a release retained or strengthened an existing
constraint; it does not create a new ADR.

ADR-0004 and ADR-0006 are historical and superseded as 0.16 RHI API decisions.
ADR-0007 remains applicable only to renderer-private recipes; none of these
three ADRs define or constrain the normative RHI API v1 surface.
